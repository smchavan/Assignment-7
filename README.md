# Assignment-7 Linked List
##Problem 1
Given a singly linked list, find middle of the linked list. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then output should be 3. 
If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to print second middle element. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then output should be 4.

##Problem 2
Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a given positive integer smaller than or equal to length of the linked list. For example, if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40.

##Problem 3
Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function).If a linked list is given as 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->NULL and k = 3 then output will be 3->2->1->6->5->4->8->7->NULL.

##Problem 4
Given a linked list, check if the the linked list has a loop. Linked list can contain self loop.

##Problem 5
Given a linked list, the task is to find the n'th node from the end.

##Problem 6
Given two linked lists sorted in ascending order. Merge them in-place and return head of the merged list.   For example, if first list is 10->20->30 and second list is 15->17, then the result list should be 10->15->17->20->30.
It is strongly recommended to do merging in-place using O(1) extra space.

##Problem 7
Given a Linked List where every node represents a linked list and contains two pointers of its type:
(i) anext pointer to the next node
(ii) a bottom pointer to a linked list where this node is head.

You have to flatten the linked list to a single linked list which is
For Ex: Shown below is a given linked list

           5 -> 10 -> 19 -> 28       |    |     |     |       V    V     V     V       7    20    22    35       |          |     |       V          V     V       8          50    40       |                |       V                V       30               45

and after flattening it, the sorted linked list looks like:

 5->7->8->10->19->20->22->28->30->35->40->45->50

The  node structure has 3 fields as mentioned. A next pointer, a bottom pointer and a data part.

##Problem 8
Given a singly linked list, write a function to swap elements pairwise. For example, if the linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then the function should change it to 2->1->4->3->5, and if the linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then the function should change it to 2->1->4->3->6->5.

##Problem 9
Given two numbers represented by two lists, write a function that returns sum list. The sum list is list representation of addition of two input numbers.
Suppose you have two linked list 5->4 ( 4 5 )and 5->4->3( 3 4 5) you have to return  a resultant linked list 0->9->3 (3 9 0).

##Problem 10
Given a singly linked list of integers, Your task is to complete the function isPalindrome that returns true if the given list is palindrome, else returns false.
